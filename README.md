# zte-sms-forwarder
Bash script to forward SMS messages from a ZTE MF286D 4G router.

Originally forked from https://gist.github.com/mariodian/bafe4b0a83226d7680ee41424c4e5b7b

Modified to work with ZTE MF286D which seems to use a different logon method.
Thanks to https://blog.aydindogm.us/posts/superbox-hacks-v1/ for help getting that to work.

Also modified to forward SMS messages to another phone number rather than using pushover.
